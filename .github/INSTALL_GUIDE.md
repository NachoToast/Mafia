## Intro

The mafia codebase consist of 2 main parts: the client and the server. Both can be run together or separately.

This installation guide will take you through the process of setting up your own local version of the client and/or server. It assumes you have a basic understanding of the command line and git.

Because of this, after going through the [prerequisites](#prerequisites), you can skip to the [client](#client) and/or [server](#server) sections depending on what you want to run.

## Prerequisites
